# LOGISTIC-REGRESSION-PROJECT

# Project Introduction
In this project a portuguese bank data is provided with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

 task is to explore our Bank's Marketing campaign and create meaningful insights from the data
 
# Section I : Data Loading
Part I : Load the dataset into the notebook
Part II : Explore and make note of Attribute Information from UCI
Part III : What is the significance of the y column in the dataset and what are the value counts of the y column?
Part IV : What is the ratio of the two classes ? Are they balanced ?

# Section II : Data Cleaning
Since this is real world data , A good practice is to make sure the dataset is devoid of any nuances

Part I : Get the dtypes of all the columns of our dataset
Part II : Refering to the UCI data description , explore the data in your columns and check if there are any errors
Part III : Make note of the deviation in the dataset compared to the description provided by UCI
Part IV : Using Data Cleaning principles you learned from Pandas Tutorial) figure out the best ways to get rid of the dirty data Part V : Print the cleaned data

# Section III : Exploring data with Group by
In this section , we must create some primitive EDA

Use the groupby function on the mean of the following columns :

I : y
II : job
III : marital
IV : education
# Section III : Exploratory Data Analysis

Part I : Create bar graphs to the frequency of purchase with respect to the job , martial etc
Part II : Also create stacked bars to same data columns with respect to
Part III : Explore the age column using a histogram and note down your observations

# Section IV : Categorical Variable Encoding
Part I : Create dummy variables for your categorial variables
part II : Explore your new dataset with these new dummy variables !

# Section V : Preliminary Training
Part I : Import your Logisitc Regression libraries
Part II : Split your train and test dataset and train on the data
Part III : Make note of the classification report and other metrics
